		<h1>Jesse's Programming Projects</h1>
		<hr />
		<br />

		<p>
			Here, I will put a list of all of the cool programming projects that I have been / am working on. If you want access to my github repository to see the code, you can <a href="www.github.com/jessesimpson36">Click Here!</a>
		</p>
		<br />

		<h3>This Website</h3>
		<p>
			This website is made from HTML and CSS text using the Sublime Text Editor. The primary function of this website is for practice using HTML and CSS. I also think making my own website is pretty cool! Later, I plan on putting it up on a custom domain when it becomes more complete.

		<h3>Men's Gymnastics Code of Points (unfinished and discontinued)</h3>

		<p>
			This was my first attempt at making and Android Application using Android Studio. My goal was to make a Program that...
			<ul>
				<li>Would allow coaches and gymnasts to access the Men's Gymnastics Code of Points</li>

				<li>Would allow coaches and gymnasts to view the compulsory routines</li>

				<li>Be available offline</li>

				<li>Would be organized enough to access these tools quickly</li>

			</ul>

			The problem came during the final steps of the program. I was unable to find a way to view pdf files without internet connection. The code is still available on my github account using the link above.

		<h3>JetMan</h3>
		<p>This was what my group consisting of Jonathan Allen, Xueer Zhu, and I created using Game Maker Studio. Its a basic platformer with velocity based controls. That is, if you press LEFT, the character will move left at a speed of ONE. Despite Game Maker's ability to create everything with little to no code, our group relied almost entirely on code... If you would like to play, you can download our project <a href="https://github.com/jessesimpson36/JetMan">HERE!!!</a></p>
