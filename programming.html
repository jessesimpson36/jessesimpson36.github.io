		<h1>Jesse's Programming Projects</h1>
		<hr />
		<br />

		<p>
			Here, I will put a list of all of the cool programming projects that I have been / am working on. If you want access to my github repository to see the code, you can <a href="www.github.com/jessesimpson36">Click Here!</a>
		</p>
		<br />

		<h3>This Website</h3>
		<p>
			This website is made from HTML and CSS text using the Sublime Text Editor. The primary function of this website is for practice using HTML and CSS. I also think making my own website is pretty cool! Later, I plan on putting it up on a custom domain when it becomes more complete.

		<h3>Men's Gymnastics Code of Points (unfinished and discontinued)</h3>

		<p>
			This was my first attempt at making and Android Application using Android Studio. My goal was to make a Program that...
			<ul>
				<li>Would allow coaches and gymnasts to access the Men's Gymnastics Code of Points</li>

				<li>Would allow coaches and gymnasts to view the compulsory routines</li>

				<li>Be available offline</li>

				<li>Would be organized enough to access these tools quickly</li>

			</ul>

			The problem came during the final steps of the program. I was unable to find a way to view pdf files without internet connection. The code is still available on my github account using the link above.

		<h3>Currently looking for cool projects...</h3>
